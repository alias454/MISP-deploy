# MISP-deploy

Deploy MISP on a RHEL based VM

Copy the contents of the **.files/** directory to the host and run **run_misp_setup.bash** script.

The Dockerfile is used for development purposes and should not be used to run this deployment.

This needs way more details for this build but it is heavily modified version of this https://github.com/NUKIB/misp
